## Who we are?
Our deveopment team consists of two members - @tdrkDev and @rtx4d.
We are enthusiasts who want M6 Note to have future.

## Why MeizuSucks?
### Security
Open-Source kernel lets you never care about privacy problems. All last Google's and Lineage OS' security patches are merged to kernel and ROM. Also while reverse-engineering stock kernel We've found **backdoors** in it.

### Drivers
Reverse-engineered and refactored drivers' code works like clockwork. Stock kernel drivers are not as optimized as they should be.

### Performance
Our [chat](https://t.me/msucks_chat) members did a research and figured out that performance increases (in some tests/games) on MeizuSucks. For example, **Call Of Duty Mobile** works fine on **Medium** graphical settings on MeizuSucks Q, but lags on **Low** graphical settings on Nougat ROMs, maybe Flyme 6/7/8.
